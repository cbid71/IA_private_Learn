# Multi agent orchestrator

## What is AI agent ?

A dedicated tool able to manipulate a specific interface as an extension, it's useful both of input or output.

**Exemple :**
 * A calculator (LLM is bad Ã  maths)
 * Gmail calendar (LLM can now create a reunion date)
 * chat agent of inputs by clients (LLM can dialog with your client, about healthcare, customers, IT supports... through a dedicated specialised client)
 * ...

Concretly speaking an agent AI is no more than a code made to interact with the input/output of a model to execute a task.

N8N is currently the most used tool to make workflows/Pipelines allowing to add agent AIs in a chain of actions to make nice stuff.

## What is an agent orchestrator
