**RNN :** (Recurrent Neural Network) Type of neural network good to handle sequences of data like text or time series.

**Bias :** a model have been trained with specific datasets, so can give non optimal answers. The bias is the measure related to this non optimal answer.


Make it clearer (section 8):
- Clustering                -> grouping similar things together
- Dimensionality reduction  -> simplifing data by reducting the number of features 
- Regression                -> preducting the X next values
- Classification            -> Sorting things into categories

**Feature :** Caracteristic of a dataset
--> example : 
```
sold houses:
- location
- size
- price
- ...
```

**Reinforcement learning**
type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions in an environment.


ROUGE (Recall Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)
**ROUGE** is a metric to **evaluate text sumarization and text generation**

**BLEU**
Metric on text translation


**Fine-Tuning**
Improve and eventually specialize a model


**F1 Score**
Measure that **balance precision and recall to evaluate a model performance** (performance==model quality result), specially when dealing with imbalanced data
