# AWS and IA

## Services :

**Amazon Sagemaker:** A fully managed service that helps developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly and easily. It provides tools for every step of the ML workflow.

**Sagemaker endpoint:** A deployed instance of a trained machine learning model in Amazon Sagemaker that you can use for making real-time predictions (inference) from your application.

**Rekognition:** An AI service that can analyze images and videos to recognize objects, people, text, scenes, and activities. It can also detect facial features and emotions.

**Comprehend:** A natural language processing (NLP) service that can understand text in different languages. It helps with tasks like sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and language detection.

**Transcribe:** A speech-to-text service that converts audio recordings into written text, useful for transcribing calls, meetings, or any audio content.

**AWS Bedrock:** A fully managed platform for building and deploying generative AI models, enabling users to create AI applications using pre-built models from various providers.

**AWS AI Agents:** These are intelligent software agents powered by AI, capable of interacting with users or systems to perform specific tasks, like customer service chatbots, based on pre-configured workflows.

**Amazon Polly:** Text to speech

**Amazon Translate:** real-time translation of text between various languages

**Amazon Lex:** Conversation using voice or text (equivalent Alexa)

**AWS Personalize:** A machine learning service that helps you build personalized recommendation systems. Itâ€™s great for tailoring product recommendations or content suggestions for users. 

**AWS Forecast:** Prediction of futur outcome based on historical Data.

**AWS Textract:** Extract data from image to text

**AWS Kendra:** Search data among variety of datasource, like documents and databases

**AWS Inferentia:** A machine learning inference chip, designed by AWS, to accelerate the performance and reduce the cost of running inference workloads at scale. 

**AWS SageMaker Studio:** IDE for building, creating and deploying ML models.

## Informations fetch :

**Green Grass:** AWS IoT Greengrass extends AWS to local devices, allowing them to run local compute, messaging, data storage, and machine learning (ML) inference capabilities. It helps devices to operate even without constant internet connectivity, syncing with the cloud when available. 

**AWS IoT:** AWS IoT (Internet of Things) is a suite of services that helps you connect Internet-connected devices (like sensors, actuators, or smart home devices) to the cloud. It provides tools for securely managing, processing, and analyzing data from devices in real time, enabling automation and monitoring.

**Databases:** RDS, DynamoDB, Aurora...

**Datalake & Datawarehouse:** S3, Dataglue (ETL), Redshift...

**Messaging services:** Will mostly act like medium between a datasource like IoT, database, log, and a model training or inference like SageMaker

**Computing:** Lambda functions...
