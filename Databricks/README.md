## What problem does Databricks solve?

What is Databricks all about? Organizations collect large volumes of data in data warehousing or data lakes. Data is frequently exchanged between them at a high frequency – a process that often turns out to be complex, costly, and non-collaborative.

Databricks solves this problem by simplifying big data analytics via the lakehouse architecture, which gives a data lake the capabilities of a data warehouse. As a result, it removes data silos that often emerge when data is pushed into a data lake or warehouse. That way, the lakehouse architecture offers data teams a single source of data.


## What is Databricks used for?

Many businesses now use a rather complicated combination of data lakes and data warehouses, with parallel data pipelines that handle data that arrives in planned batches or real-time streams. Next, they typically add an array of other analytics, business intelligence, and data science tools on top. 

Databricks makes this approach obsolete because it has everything data practitioners need under one roof: a lakehouse architecture.

Some common use cases of Databricks include:

 * Collecting all of your data in one location 
 * Handling both batch data and real-time data streams
 * Transforming and organizing data
 * Performing computations on data
 * Querying data 
 * Analyzing data and generating reports to support business decision-making

Naturally, you can also combine Databricks with other technologies inside your data ecosystem. Many teams get started with Databricks this way to understand what the platform is capable of and how it can help them solve the most pressing data-related challenges. 


## Databricks vs. database vs. data warehouse

It’s important to clarify the differences between databases, data warehouses, lakes, and Databricks, which proposes a brand-new architecture: data lakehouse.

### Database

A database is a tool that collects data and is often used to enable Online Transaction Processing (OLTP). Database Management Systems (DBMS) are types of software that store data in databases and allow users and applications to interact with the data. 
### Data warehouse

A data warehouse is a system that collects and maintains highly organized data from numerous sources. Typically, traditional cloud data warehouses contains both current and historical data from one or more systems. You can use a data warehouse to consolidate diverse data sources in order to analyze the data, search for insights, and provide business information (BI) in the form of reports and dashboards.
### Data lake

A data lake is a collection of data from several sources kept in its original, unprocessed form. Like data warehouses, lakes hold massive volumes of current and historical data. Data lakes are distinguished by their capacity to store data in a number of forms, such as JSON, BSON, CSV, TSV, Avro, ORC, and Parquet.

The primary goal of a data lake is often to analyze data to deliver insights. However, teams will occasionally employ lakes for cheap storage with the intention of using the data for analytics in the future.
### Data lakehouse

A data lakehouse is a new type of open data management architecture that combines the scalability, flexibility, and low cost of a data lake with the data management and ACID transactions of data warehouses. This lets you do BI and ML on any data.

A Databricks lakehouse integrates identical data structures and data management functions to those in a data warehouse, directly on the type of low-cost storage used for data lakes. By merging these two approaches into a single system, data teams can work faster since they can find all the data they need in one place. Data lakehouses also guarantee that teams have access to the most current and complete data for data science, machine learning, and business analytics initiatives.
