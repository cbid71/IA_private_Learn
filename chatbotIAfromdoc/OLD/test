== Considerations

When using transient users, you should be aware of the following:

- In the Admin Console, transitive users can be only tracked from their
  respective client session. They cannot be looked up using
  the Users search because they are not stored
  in any user store. For the same reason, it is not possible to add additional
  authentication factors to them.

- Roles and groups can be assigned to the transient users only by
  identity provider mappers of the respective identity provider.
  This is especially important for the `default-roles-{realm-name}` realm role,
  which is added to regular users automatically, but has to be assigned
  to transient users also through a mapper (e.g. the `Hardcoded Role` mapper type).

  An alternative to the Hardcoded Role mapper approach is to use groups which allows for more flexible role mappings.
  To do so, create a group like `transient-users` and assign the `default-roles-{realm-name}` realm role to it.
  Then add a Hardcoded Group mapper to the identity-provider and select the `transient-users` group.
  This will ensure that all roles associated with the `transient-users` group are automatically assigned to the brokered users.

- Since every transient user is created afresh, mappers always
  work in the `Import` sync mode.
